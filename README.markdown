Flippable
============================

Flippable is a Swift protocol for when you just have to flip stuff up.

Just extend your favourite class, implement flip() and youâ€™re ready to go.

Included are implementations for String, UIView and UIImage, plus handy prefix and postfix operators to flip in stile.
